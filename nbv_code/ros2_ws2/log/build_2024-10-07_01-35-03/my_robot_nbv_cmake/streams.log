[1.370s] [0mCMake Deprecation Warning at /home/jajayu/open3d_install/lib/cmake/Open3D/Open3DConfig.cmake:18 (cmake_policy):
[1.370s]   The OLD behavior for policy CMP0072 will be removed from a future version
[1.370s]   of CMake.
[1.370s] 
[1.371s]   The cmake-policies(7) manual explains that the OLD behaviors of all
[1.371s]   policies are deprecated and that a policy should be set to OLD only under
[1.371s]   specific short-term circumstances.  Projects should be ported to the NEW
[1.371s]   behavior and not rely on setting a policy to OLD.
