[0mCMake Deprecation Warning at /home/jajayu/open3d_install/lib/cmake/Open3D/Open3DConfig.cmake:18 (cmake_policy):
  The OLD behavior for policy CMP0072 will be removed from a future version
  of CMake.

  The cmake-policies(7) manual explains that the OLD behaviors of all
  policies are deprecated and that a policy should be set to OLD only under
  specific short-term circumstances.  Projects should be ported to the NEW
  behavior and not rely on setting a policy to OLD.

[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:69 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findopen3d_conversions.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "open3d_conversions", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "open3d_conversions" with any of the following names:

    open3d_conversionsConfig.cmake
    open3d_conversions-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "open3d_conversions" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "open3d_conversions_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "open3d_conversions" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
